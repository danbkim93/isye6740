With well known Pima Indians with diabetes dataset, I've applied several machine learning classification models including RidgeClassifier, Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Net, and AdaBoost and compared performance of those models. Accuracy, F1 scores, and CV scores are used as performance metrics.
